Graphql Schema
-----------------------------------
* GraphQLInterfaceType()
* GraphQLObjectType() 
    - query and interface subtypes.
* GraphQLSchema(
    query: queryType,
    types: [objectType, objectType],
  ); 
    
Graphql database read/writes (resolvers) 
-----------------------------------
* next generation JavaScript functions.
* written according to flow static type style.
* resolver functions are built here which are used
  by schema resolvers. 
* server object is available in read/write functions.


Completed sample of concept below issue.
A promise returns the schema so async await can be used
to generate the schema.

Issue: to pass hapi server object to
       the schema builder function. Which gives server object
       to resolver functions. So, server.app.db is available.
