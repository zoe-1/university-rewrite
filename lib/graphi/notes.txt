Graphql Schema
----------------------------------------
* GraphQLInterfaceType()
* GraphQLObjectType()
    - query and interface subtypes.
* GraphQLSchema(
    query: queryType,
    types: [objectType, objectType],
  );

Graphql database read/writes (resolvers)
----------------------------------------
* next generation JavaScript functions.
* written according to flow static type style.
* resolver functions are built here which are used
  by schema resolvers.
* server object is available in read/write functions.


Completed sample of concept below issue.
A promise returns the schema so async await can be used
to generate the schema.

Issue: to pass hapi server object to
       the schema builder function. Which gives server object
       to resolver functions. So, server.app.db is available.

Two ways to build resolver functions
-----------------------------------------
* First way is already built. server options are passed
  to plugins.
* Second way is build an object set the object in the
  graphi resolver options. Do this for the mutation requests.
